* what happens when I connect the the laptop to ethernet cable and write https://www.google.com :

now we are in the pysical layer when we dealing with bits in the cable the secound layer when the switche start to recognize my laptop Mac address 

which is fixed the the third layer then we take an IP address from the DHCP server or manually 

the fourth layer it decide if the connection will be TCP or UDP 

in the fifth layer we choose the session protocols 

and in the oresentation layer the data from all encrypt and decrypt protocols 

then the high level layaer application procolos which dealing with http, ftp, smtp, ..... etc protocols 


The difference between TCP and UDP ?


TCP :

uses thre way handcheck the browser send SYN and the server send ACK and the browser send ACKBACK 

it uses when sending important data and don't want to loss any packets like Emails, important files , ....Etc

Slower than UDP 

important note :

Tcp protocole rearrange the packets and combine them again 

UDP :

Don't uses any way of acknowledment 

it is used to transer un important data or data you won't care if some packets losses in the way 

Faster than TCP 

like : VOIP and Video Streaming.

Wireshark :

A software used to trace all the traffics on the network
